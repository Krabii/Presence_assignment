# Presence_assignment
A MILP formulation of a rotating schedule for school-home presence

This is a scheduling problem for a school, for reducing the in-class attendance.
The problem tries to create an equally distributed schedule for a single class where 
students can have presential and in-house time, while assuring that the human iteractions 
are equally distributed so that all pairs of students can have meet on their school days.

Also gender equallity is modeled in the problem in order to avoid having boys-days or girls-days.
